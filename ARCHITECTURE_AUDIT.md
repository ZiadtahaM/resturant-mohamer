## 2. Security Hardening
- Validated inputs using strictly typed schemas (e.g., Zod).
- Enforced JWT validation on all protected endpoints.
- Removed hardcoded secrets; enforced environment variable usage.
- Enabled standard security headers (Helmet) & rate limiting.

## 3. Clean Code & Optimization
- Eliminated ny types.
- Optimized DB calls (removed N+1 queries, stripped DB calls from loops).
- Added structured error handling and logging.
- Set up smart git automation hooks.
